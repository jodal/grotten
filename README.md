  <em>text-based dungeon explorer developed together with an 8-year-old</em>
</p>


## Disclaimer

Grotten is a very basic text-based dungeon explorer. It is probably only
entertaining to the two core developers.


## Developers

- **The dad**, who has fun modelling game state and refactoring over and over,
  while trying to teach some basics related to computers, programming, and
  Python to the iPad generation.

- **The 8-year-old son**, who is constantly wondering when we're reaching
  feature parity with *Zelda: Breath of the Wild*.


## Usage

1. Clone Git repo and change into the project directory:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:jodal/grotten.git
    cd grotten
    ```

2. Install dependencies with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

    ```
    poetry install
    ```

3. List available command line options:

    python -m grotten --help
    ```

4. Run the game:

    ```
    python -m grotten
    ```
